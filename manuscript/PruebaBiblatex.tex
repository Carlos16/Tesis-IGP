%% The following lines are for two sided printing where the page numbers
%% and the margins are different for the even numbered and odd numbered
%% pages.  If your front matter does not contain an even number of pages 
%% you need an extra blank page so that page one of the text is a right 
%% handed page.  Please note that depending on your printer and how you 
%% print out your thesis, you may need to add an extra piece of paper here 
%% when you put the first sided copies back in the printer.
