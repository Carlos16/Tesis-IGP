Introduction
============

This file contains all the documentation for the code written for my undergraduate thesis, which explores the relationship that exist between predator body mass and resource-consumer body size ratios over the assembly mechanism of the *intraguild predation* module.  
More formally I explore mathematical models of the form :  
..math::

  \frac{dR}{dt} &= F(R) - G_c(R)C - G_p(R,C)P \\
  \frac{dC}{dt} &= \epsilon_1G_c(R)C - H_p(R,C)P - q_1C \\
  \frac{dP}{dt} &= P(\epsilon_2G_p(R,C) + \epsilon_3 H_p(R,C) - q_2)

And find invasibility conditions for each of the subcases assuming point attractors in the *recipient* community.  

*More information will come ...*
